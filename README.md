# movie_ontology
The movie/film industry becomes more data-driven. That trend is set to continue as the industry pulls in data from even more diverse distribution platforms and sources. The increasing focus on data highlights the need to connect the disparate data sources and disconnected data silos that populate the entertainment landscape. 
As the business grows, studios will acquire more consumption data from more sources, requiring new and better tools to analyze that data for purposes of competitive analysis, affinity analysis, and marketing decision making across franchises, universes, and channels. Studios and distributors will continue to deploy more powerful machine learning and AI tools that thrive on massive aggregations of data from multiple sources. The challenges an ontology addresses will only increase. Adoption and deployment of a common, machine-to-machine ontology will result in faster, more efficient integration of data, faster, more efficient development of applications to keep the industry competitive, and faster, more meaningful insights from data that includes connections surfaced by the ontology.
